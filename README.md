# AntiFBTHeavenLag
Since map creator is a dumbass (even approached them with the exploit) and too many people cried about me doing it. I decided to release this since it's getting boring to make everyone spawn bottles and lag the world. Really simple harmony patch on initiate object if it the dynamicprefabname starts with "Assets" and matches fbt heaven's worldId. Melonloader 0.3.0 required.
